# Bonus: Anagram Detector Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build a class that uses an initialize method
- Use an attribute accessor macro to make an attribute available to a class's
  methods
- Practice using Ruby Array methods

## Description

You will write a program that, given a word and a list of possible
[anagrams][anagrams], selects the correct one(s).

Your class, `Anagram` should take a word on initialization; instances should
respond to a `#match` instance method that takes an array of possible anagrams.
It should return all matches in an array. If no matches exist, it should return
an empty array.

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `%w[enlists google inlets banana]` the
program should return `["inlets"]`.

```ruby
listen = Anagram.new("listen")
listen.match(%w[enlists google inlets banana])

# => ["inlets"]
```

**Top Tip:** [`%w[some words]`][array_shortcut] is simply a shortcut for
instantiating an array of strings!

## Instructions

Once again, this lab is test-driven. Run the test suite to get started. Remember
that you can use the `learn --fail-fast` option to run the tests only up until
the first failure, in order to work progressively through the tests.

Write your solution in `anagram.rb`.

This is a difficult lab that will require some algorithmic thinking! Try breaking
writing out some pseudocode and break the problem down into smaller steps before
writing out your implementation.

**Hints:**

How will you determine if one word is an anagram for another?

You'll need to iterate over the array of words that the `#match` method
takes as an argument. You will compare each word of that array to the word
that the Anagram class is initialized with.

To determine one word is an anagram of another word, try determining if they are
composed of the same letters. You can use the `#chars` method on a string to
get an array of its individual letters:

```rb
"hello".chars
# ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```

You can compare two arrays using the `==`. For example:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]
# => true

[1, 3, 2] == [1, 2, 3]
# => false
```

Two arrays are equal if they contain the same elements, in the same order.
Remember that you can `#sort` an array's elements. This will help in your
comparison:

```ruby
[1, 3, 2].sort == [3, 2, 1].sort
# => true
```
